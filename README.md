#### **My Shell Prompt!**

> If you are using android studio and often work on theminal, I really don't recommend using this theme, I haven't found what problem makes it so messy while in other editors like VS Code there is no problem everything is normal. It would be better if you update the shell path on android studio to bash or something else.

This is my **Terminal** theme that runs on **Arch Linux** OS. Yes **Terminal**, this is my residence, where all my activities are done here in operating **Arch Linux**, therefore I need a terminal that makes me comfortable to use it and below are some **Tech Stack** that I use to support my productivity. previously I used the **Powerlevel10k** theme and then I added another new theme with a costum theme using **Oh My Posh** and this is the last theme I used and maybe in the future I will make a new costume theme and update it in this repository.

#### **My Shell Prompt!**

> **Note**: The mistake I made was using UTF code with two parts like this `\udb85\ude5d` and when I was working in the **Android Studio** terminal then what was `final_space = true` as if the value was `false`, so there was quite a bit of word switching, and if I used too much UTF code it would get messy. Maybe it's my fault for not reading all the **Oh My Posh** documentation, and if you are using this theme or want to modify it please be aware of the UTF codes you will choose and don't worry I have fixed all these themes.

This is my **Terminal** theme that runs on **Arch Linux** OS. Yes **Terminal**, this is my residence, where all my activities are done here in operating **Arch Linux**, therefore I need a terminal that makes me comfortable to use it and below are some **Tech Stack** that I use to support my productivity. previously I used the **Powerlevel10k** theme and then I added another new theme with a costum theme using **Oh My Posh** and this is the last theme I used and maybe in the future I will make a new costume theme and update it in this repository.

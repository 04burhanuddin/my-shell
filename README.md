### **My Shell Prompt!**
This is my **Terminal** theme that runs on **Arch Linux** OS. Yes **Terminal**, this is my residence, where all my activities are done here in operating **Arch Linux**, therefore I need a terminal that makes me comfortable to use it and below are some **Tech Stack** that I use to support my productivity. previously I used the **Powerlevel10k** theme and then I added another new theme with a costum theme using **Oh My Posh** and this is the last theme I used and maybe in the future I will make a new costume theme and update it in this repository.
